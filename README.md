# Cloud Study Jam

Want to get started on the Google Cloud, but don't know where to begin? Join us for our Cloud Study Jam!  

Get official Google training, a $55+ value, free of charge. Together we'll work through 4 Google Cloud labs. You will get hands-on experience with the cloud console, Kubernetes and Machine Learning.   

Then after the meetup, you will have free access to 3 more labs you can finish at home. Complete all 7 labs and earn a Google-hosted badge for your online profile.  

Bring a laptop (PC, Mac or Chromebook)! The labs will run on all of the latest versions of the popular browsers. For the best experience, make sure your laptop has Firefox or Chrome installed.
